The task:
As youâ€™re a very friendly person, you would like to send a birthday note to all friends that you have.
But you have a lot of friends and you are a bit lazy, it may take some time to write all the notes by hand.

The good news is that computers can do it automatically for you.

Imagine you have a list of friends (Users) coming to a REST endpoint via JSON
And you want to send them a happy birthday email on their birthday:

```
Subject: Happy birthday!

Happy birthday, dear <first_name>!
```

Implement a solution that sends the message to the friends that have a birthday today.
